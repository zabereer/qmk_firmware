# smt Clueboard Layout (HHKB variant)

![Clueboard Layout Image](layout.png)

This is smt's HHKB variant layout, based on the default layout that comes
flashed on every Clueboard. The primary differences from the default are:

- The Backspace key is moved down into the traditional `\` position
- `\` and `` ` `` are assigned to the "split-backspace" positions
- The right Shift is split to allow for a Fn key to its right
- The modifiers on the right side now mirror the left side (`Alt`/`Super`/`Ctrl`)

For the most part, it's a straightforward and easy to follow layout. There
are a few special keys:

- The Esc key sends `Esc` when tapped, `` ` `` when `Alt`/`Super`/`Ctrl`/`Fn` is held, or `~` when `Shift` is held
- The Tab key sends `Tab` when tapped, or `Super+Ctrl+Alt+Shift` (a.k.a. [Hyper]) when held
- The key traditionally in the Caps-Lock position has been re-mapped to send `Esc` when tapped, or `Ctrl` when held
- The left Shift key sends `Enter` when tapped, or `Shift` when held
