# ErgoDox EZ 1337 configuration

Custom layout based on the default layout. Intended for interational users of us intl-altgr layout. Note that
some common keys might be missing, as this layout is intented to be used on *nix systems by users familiar
with their system. The layout is geared towards avoiding using the rat (mouse for those of you who are
unfamiliar with tiling window managers) as much as possibly.
